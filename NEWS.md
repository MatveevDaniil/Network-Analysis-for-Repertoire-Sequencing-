# 0.0.9013
* R Documentation files added for package functions:
    * `aggregateIdenticalClones`
    * `filterClonesBySequenceLength`
    * `getSimilarClones`
    * `generateNetworkFromClones`
    * `generateNetworkFromAdjacencyMat`
    * `addNodeNetworkStats`
    * `node_stat_settings`
    * `addClusterMembership`
    * `getClusterStats`
* Implemented on-install testing of package functions using package `testthat`

# 0.0.9012
* Package name changed to NAIR (Network Analysis for Immune Repertoire)
* Added `findPublicClusters()`
* `buildClustersAroundSelectedClones()` renamed to `getAssociatedClusters()`
* `getPotentialAssociatedClones()` renamed to `findAssociatedClones()`
* `generateAtchleyCorrHeatmap()` renamed to `kmeansAtchley()`
* `levAdjacencyMatSparse()` and `hamAdjacencyMatSparse()` have a new argument `drop_isolated_nodes` that can be set to `FALSE` to keep isolated nodes. This argument has been added to higher-level functions that dispatch calls to these routines.

# 0.0.9011
* Separate function `embedClonesByAtchleyFactor()` created to perform embedding of TCR CDR3 amino acid sequences in Euclidean 30-space based on Atchley factor representation; this was previously done within the function `adjacencyMatAtchleyFromClones()`, but has now been placed in its own function for more general use
* New function `analyzeDiseaseAssociatedClusters()` created, which is used to perform a combined network analysis on the disease-associated clusters generated by `generateDiseaseAssociatedClusters()`
* New function `generateAtchleyCorrHeatmap()` created
* `graphics`, `reshape2`, `gplots`, `viridisLite` and `RColorBrewer` added as package dependencies via the `Imports` directive of the `DESCRIPTION` file

# 0.0.9010
* `computeMetaForCandidateSeqs()` (helper for `findDiseaseMotifsFromMergedSamples()`) redesigned and renamed to `findDiseaseAssociatedClones()`; this function now takes only the merged sample data as its input data, and filters sequences by a set of criteria (number of samples shared by and minimum seq length) to obtain the list of candidates before conducting the Fisher's exact tests; previously the list of candidates was obtained as input data to the function.
* `findDiseaseMotifsFromMergedSamples()` redesigned to use candidate sequence metadata as input (previously it computed this metadata from the merged sample data) and renamed to `generateDiseaseAssociatedClusters()`
* `generateNetworkWithStats()` now automatically prints the ggraph in R when called (previously the user needed to access the variable `graph_plot` contained in the returned list)
* Added package `dplyr` as a dependency via the `Imports` directive of the `DESCRIPTION` file

# 0.0.9009
* `buildNetwork()` renamed to `generateNetworkWithStats()`
* `adjacencyMatrix()` renamed to `sparseAdjacencyMatFromClones()`
* `genNetworkGraph()` renamed to `generateNetworkFromAdjacencyMat()`
* Added general-purpose helper functions:
    * `aggregateCountsByAminoAcidSeq`
    * `filterDataBySequenceLength`
    * `generateNetworkFromClones`
    * `computeNodeNetworkStats`
    * `addClusterMembership`
    * `computeClusterNetworkStats`
    * `plotNetworkGraph`
    * `adjacencyMatAtchleyFromClones`
* Added function `findDiseaseMotifsFromMergedSamples` and helper functions:
    * `computeMetaForCandidateSeqs`
    * `subsetDataNearTargetMotif`
* Added vignette for `generateNetworkWithStats()`
    
    
# 0.0.9008
* New function `hamDistBounded` for computing bounded Hamming distance in C++
    * Supports strings of unequal length; the longer string is effectively truncated to the length of the shorter string, and the difference in length is added to the Hamming distance with the truncated version.  This is equivalent to extending the shorter string to the length of the longer string by appending placeholder characters that differ from their counterparts in the longer string.
* New function `hamAdjacencyMatSparse` for computing Hamming adjacency matrix in C++
* Changes to function `adjacencyMatrix`: 
    * Now supports `dist_type = "hamming"` to use Hamming distance for determining network adjacency
    * Original indices of input sequences that appear in the adjacency matrix are stored in the row names of the output matrix; the sequences themselves are stored in the column names (accessible via `dimnames()`)
    * The file `col_ids.txt` created by the C++ function that computes the adjacency matrix is now deleted by `adjacencyMatrix()` after it has finished its other tasks.  The information in the file is now stored in the row names of the output matrix and so the file is no longer needed.
    

# 0.0.9007
* `.genNetworkGraph()` internal helper for `buildNetwork()` renamed into a public version `genNetworkGraph()` for use by other package functions and by users; moved to a new file `utils.R` that will be used to house shared helper functions used by multiple package functions.
* Added `inst/python/Atchley_factors.csv`, which stores the Atchley factor amino acid embedding used by `BriseisEncoder.py`


# 0.0.9006
* Python module `tensorflow` added to `installPythonModules()` and Config/reticulate field of the DESCRIPTION file. `tensorflow` is required by the Python module `keras`.


# 0.0.9005
* file `zzz.R`  created with .onUnload() directive to unload package dll via call to `library.dynam.unload()` when the package is unloaded


# 0.0.9004
* Reintroduced reticulate package dependency as well as R .onLoad() directives and R functions related to python integration, dependency management and module installation
* Added Python source code for BriseisEncoder and h5 trained encoder file
* Removed $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) from PKG_CXXFLAGS and PKG_LIBS in Makevars as OpenMP is not supported for MacOS (still enabled in Makevars.win). Added comments with instructions for Linux users to enable OpenMP if desired, and added a corresponding note to the main Readme file's installation section for Linux users.


# 0.0.9003
* Removed Python source code (previously used to compute adjacency matrix)
* Removed reticulate package dependency (previously used to manage python dependencies)
* Removed R functions involved in Python management and calling Python scripts
* Changed internal helper R function .createAdjacencyMatrix() to public function adjacencyMatrix() and switched its calls to Python scripts for building the matrix into a call to the corresponding new C++ version added in 0.0.9002 (currently only Levenshtein distance is implemented; Hamming distance will be implemented in a future update)
* Changed buildNetwork() function to use adjacencyMatrix() instead of the previous function .createAdjacencyMatrix()
* Removed levAdjacencyMatDense in favor of always using levAdjacencyMatSparse
* Enabled ARMA_64BIT_WORD to accommodate larger matrices when using the C++ function levAdjacencyMatSparse; specifically, #define ARMA_64BIT_WORD=1 was added to the beginning of each .cpp source file, and -DARMA_64BIT_WORD=1 was added to the PKG_CXXFLAGS definition in Makevars and Makevars.win


# 0.0.9002
* Added internal support for Rcpp
* Added C++ routine for bounded Levenshtein distance (levDistBounded)
* Added C++ routine for dense Levenshtein adjacency matrix (levAdjacencyMatDense)
* Added C++ routine for sparse Levenshtein adjacency matrix (levAdjacencyMatSparse)


# 0.0.9001
