## With R 3.1.0 or later, you can uncomment the following line to tell R to
## enable compilation with C++11 (where available)
##
## Also, OpenMP support in Armadillo prefers C++11 support. However, for wider
## availability of the package we do not yet enforce this here.  It is however
## recommended for client packages to set it.
##
## And with R 3.4.0, and RcppArmadillo 0.7.960.*, we turn C++11 on as OpenMP
## support within Armadillo prefers / requires it
## CXX_STD = CXX11

## OpenMP is used by Armadillo to automatically parallelize certain expensive
## operations such as elementwise matrix operations; it is not supported on
## MacOS, so we leave it disabled it by default:
PKG_CXXFLAGS =  -DARMA_64BIT_WORD=1
PKG_LIBS = $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)

## If installing on Linux, OpenMP can be enabled by commenting out the two lines
## above and uncommenting the two lines below:
## PKG_CXXFLAGS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) -DARMA_64BIT_WORD=1
## PKG_LIBS = $(SHLIB_OPENMP_CXXFLAGS) $(LAPACK_LIBS) $(BLAS_LIBS) $(FLIBS)
